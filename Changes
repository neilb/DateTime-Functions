Revision history for Perl module DateTime::Functions

0.12 2016-07-03 NEILB
    - Still had $VERSION hard-coded in the module, instead of letting
      DZ set it for me. Thanks to MANWAR who pointed this out.

    - ASCIIfied Audrey's name in dist.ini, so it will end up as ASCII
      in Makefile.PL. The kanji was causing a panic on an old Perl.
      I should fix this properly, but Audrey++ was ok with me ASCII'ing
      her name, which was the quicker route to all green on CPAN Testers.

    - Added "use warnings", changed "use vars" to use our variables,
      and changed from "use base" to "use parent".

    - Changed license section in doc to have expected head1 text
